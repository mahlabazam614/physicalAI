# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Focus
**Physics simulation and environment building.**

Before deploying code to an expensive and potentially dangerous physical robot, we test everything in a "Digital Twin"—a high-fidelity simulation of the robot and its environment.

## Key Topics

### Simulating Physics in Gazebo
-   Gravity, friction, and collisions.
-   Rigid Body Dynamics.
-   Setting up a testing world with obstacles and terrain.

### High-fidelity rendering in Unity
-   Using Unity for photorealistic visualization.
-   Human-robot interaction scenarios.
-   Importing URDF models into Unity.

### Simulating Sensors
-   **LiDAR**: Light Detection and Ranging for mapping.
-   **Depth Cameras**: Simulating RGB-D data (like Intel RealSense).
-   **IMU**: Inertial Measurement Units for balance and orientation.

## Weekly Breakdown

### Weeks 6-7: Robot Simulation with Gazebo
-   Gazebo simulation environment setup
-   URDF and SDF robot description formats
-   Physics simulation and sensor simulation
-   Introduction to Unity for robot visualization

## Assessment
**Gazebo simulation implementation**: Successfully simulate a mobile robot in a maze environment with working LiDAR and Camera sensors.
