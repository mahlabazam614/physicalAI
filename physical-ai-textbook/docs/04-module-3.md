# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Focus
**Advanced perception and training.**

This module introduces NVIDIA Isaac™, an accelerated computing platform for robotics. We move from basic control to advanced perception and AI-driven navigation.

## Key Topics

### NVIDIA Isaac Sim
-   Photorealistic simulation.
-   Synthetic data generation for training computer vision models.

### Isaac ROS
-   Hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
-   Using the GPU to process visual data in real-time.

### Nav2: Path planning
-   Navigation stack for bipedal humanoid movement.
-   Planning paths around obstacles dynamically.

## Weekly Breakdown

### Weeks 8-10: NVIDIA Isaac Platform
-   NVIDIA Isaac SDK and Isaac Sim
-   AI-powered perception and manipulation
-   Reinforcement learning for robot control
-   Sim-to-real transfer techniques

## Assessment
**Isaac-based perception pipeline**: configure a VSLAM pipeline using Isaac ROS nodes to map a room.
